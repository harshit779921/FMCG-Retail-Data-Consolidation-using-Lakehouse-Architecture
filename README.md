# FMCG Data Engineering Project (Databricks Free Edition)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built using Databricks Free Edition for an FMCG business use case. It covers data ingestion from multiple sources, handling full and incremental loads, transforming raw data, and preparing analytics-ready datasets.

## Tech Stack
- Databricks (Apache Spark)
- PySpark
- SQL
- CSV Files

## Key Features
- Full and incremental data load implementation
- Multi-source data ingestion (Parent & Child companies)
- Data cleansing and transformations
- Analytics-ready data for reporting

## Data Pipeline Flow
1. Ingest raw CSV data into Databricks
2. Perform full load for initial data setup
3. Process incremental data for updates
4. Apply transformations using PySpark and SQL
5. Create final datasets for analytics

## Use Case
FMCG analytics including sales analysis, customer insights, and pricing evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Upload the project files to Databricks Workspace
2. Create a cluster using Databricks Free Edition
3. Execute notebooks in sequence: ingestion, processing, transformation, analytics
